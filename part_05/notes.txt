1. compilation vs interpretation:
    compilation: entire code is converted to machine code at once, and written to a bianry file that can be executed by a computer
        Source code -->(compilation)machine code -->(execute)program running
    interpretation: interpretation run through the Source code and execute it line by line
        source code -->(execute)program running                 note: source code will still be converted to machine code, they just happen the same time

    compilation is faster than interpretation

    modern JS is the mix of compilation and interpretation:
        entire code is converted to machine code at once, and NOT written to a bianry file, machine code is execute right after convertion by a computer
