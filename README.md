# JavaScript Learning Journey Code Repository :rocket:

Welcome to my repository! This is a collection of code that I wrote during my self-study of JavaScript. Here you will find 4 different projects that I have developed thus far in my journey. Each is unique in its application, reflecting the progress and skills I have acquired. 

## :pushpin: Projects Overview

I will continue to expand this repository as I keep learning and building more projects. My journey in learning JavaScript is ongoing, and I believe that by sharing these projects, it can provide insights to others who are also on this path.
